# Etch-a-Sketch
create etch-a-sketch style game in browser
 Game spawns a 16 x 16 grid of divs which will change color when mouse is hovered. Creates etch-a-sketch effect. 
When first drawing is complete, user can click button at top of screen to reset the board.  They will be prompted to 
enter a column size for the next grid, which can be any (user-input) x (user-input) up until 100.  New board will
be in the same window.  Still working on responsiveness.
